# GoodMapGenGodot
## WARNING THIS IS A WIP

I plan to create a libaray or addon that generates a Map that can be used for any **2d or 3d** Game ðŸ¤žðŸ¤ž

- Goals:
  - Create functions to allow vivid maps to be generated
  - Load map generation on a seperate thread and allow background loading of them
  - Higlighy customizable generation 

- Sources (so far):
